## About Me

I am Ina Krapp, currently a Ph.D. student in Economics at Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, Germany, and a Research Assistant at the Leibniz Institute for Financial Research SAFE. My primary interest lies in the intersection of Human Geography and Economics, and the contributions Data Science can bring to these fields.

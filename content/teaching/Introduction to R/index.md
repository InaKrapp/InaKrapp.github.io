## What is R?

R is a programming language often used for Data Analysis.

Programming your analysis with R instead of doing it in, say, Excel, has a large number of advantages:

1.  It can easily be rerun. You can change your input (for example, append more data) and simply rerun everything instead of having to click through the whole analysis again. That also makes it much more replicable: You never need to worry about forgetting what you did. Anyone else can replicate your analysis easily as well.
2.  R is non-commercial. It is free, so you never have to worry about license fees!
3.  Related to that, anyone can implement and customize anything in R. You never have to wait for a company to finally release a new version with that new function everyone waited for.

RStudio is a user interface.
